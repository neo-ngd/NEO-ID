# NEO-ID

## Next steps

- Validate which crypto algorithm are available in NEO. The Ethereum impl. demo is based on secp256k1 and Keccak256.
- Starting a NEO impl. First step is to Sign and validate the signature in the smart contract. If this works the rest shouldn't be a problem.
- Agree on the interface definition. Which methods do we want to have in the NEP?
