<p align="center">Seraph ID DID Definition.</p>

# Abstract

To introduce Self-Sovereign Identity support in the NEO blockchain and enforce compatibility
with the raising standards we propose a DID method for NEO. The DID is a pre-requisite for the [Seraph ID](https://seraphid.io). 

The W3C Credentials Community Group [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) standard was choosen for future interopability
with other Decentralized Identifier provider. The following DID Method will be registered on [DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/).

## NEO-DID Method Definition

### Context
As defined in the W3C Credentials Community Group [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) standard the context is defined as

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1"
}
```

### Subject
The choosen subject is "neo" and the following format is required:

```json
did = "did:neo:" network ":" specific-idstring
network = ("test" / "main")
specific-idstring = NEO Public address (see below)
```

`specific-idstring` will be generated using a NEO Public address = `base58check(ScriptHash)`, where `ScriptHash = RIPMD160(SHA256(publicKey))`

```json
<pre>
{
  "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X"
}
```

### Public Keys
A public key section is defined in order to support encryption and cryptography operations.
The public key is generated accordingly to the NEO cryptography available support.
If the identity is public in the network (on-chain identity) then its smart contract public address will be also listed in the available public keys. 

```json
 "publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X#keys-1",
    "type": "EdDsaSAPublicKeySecp256r1",
    "controller": "did:neo:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  },{
    "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X#keys-2",
    "type": "EdDsaSAPublicKeySecp256r1",
    "controller": "did:neo:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X",
    "publicKeyBase58": "J5D3ADfNNv6gmMAgNjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6x4FprfkcsADS"
  }]
```

### Authorization
Authorization section is not necessary.

### Service Endpoint
Given the versatile nature of NEO Seraph ID for public, on-chain identity, endpoint to interact with the identity itself is represented by a smart contract. For off-chain, discrete identity, using SBIS as identity cloud manager, a specific endpoint is provided.

```json
  "service": [{
    "type": "smartContractService",
    "serviceEndpoint":"https://www.cloudservice1.org/me"
  },{
    "type": "cloudWallet",
    "serviceEndpoint":"https://me.cloudservice2.com"
  }]
```

## Method Example
The following example shows the extensive DID method definition proposed for a single, public, on-chain identity (e.g. Issuer).
```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X",
  "publicKey": [{
    "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X#keys-1",
    "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:neo:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  },{
    "id": "did:neo:main:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X#keys-2",
    "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:neo:AefrasH3wVfReDogQMx2LHq9o6XEAVTv8X",
    "publicKeyBase58": "J5D3ADfNNv6gmMAgNjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6x4FprfkcsADS"
  }],
  "service": [{
    "type": "smartContractService",
    "serviceEndpoint":"https://www.cloudservice1.org/me"
  },{
    "type": "SBISService",
    "serviceEndpoint":"https://me.cloudservice2.com"
  }]
}
```

## NEO-DID Operations
The following DID operations should be defined as requested by the DID defintion. Each public DID in the NEO network capable to issue credentials is either:

- represented by a single smart contract (each issuer needs to deploy its own smart contract and will be capable to interact with its DID through the smart contract itself)

or

- listed on a DID whitelist (a main authority, e.g. "NEO-SSI", will deploy the "whitelist smartcontract". A new DID should be then created, updated, deleted and read sending a specific transaction to the specific method. 

Based on the decision taken on the design the following 4 operations would change

### Create (register)
### Read/Verify
### Update
### Delete/Revoke
